=================================
  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
=================================
This is the source code of a fully-fledged SystemVerilog verification
environment using the Universal Verification Methodology.  The Design
Under-Test (DUT) is a 10GE MAC Core whose source code is available under
the LGPL license from OpenCores.org:
  http://opencores.org/project,xge_mac

This verification environment was developed as the final project of the 
"System and Functional Verification Using UVM" course at the UCSC Silicon
Valley Extension.  For additional information, take a look at the 
verification document available in the doc/ directory.


=================================
  VERIFICATION PLAN DOCUMENT
=================================
The verification plan is available in the doc/ directory.  This document
describes the whole testbench environment and all its components in detail.
An appendix that explains the 2 bugs that were found as part of this project
has been also added to the verification plan.


=================================
  TESTBENCH'S FILE STRUCTURE
=================================
Here is a brief description of each one of the directories in this project:
 * doc/:  PDF verification plan (aka testplan).
 * rtl/:  Verilog source code for the DUT.
 * scripts/:  Scripts required to run a regression.
 * sim/:  runsim files for all testcases with the required VCS flags.
 * testbench/:  Source code for all the testbench components.
 * testcases/:  Test case files.


=================================
  HOW TO RUN A TEST/REGRESSION?
=================================
Go to the scripts/ directory and type "make".  This will display the Makefile
usage.  You can choose to run all the test cases at once in a regression-like
manner as shown below:

 > make regress

You can also run one test case by providing the make target alias that is shown
in the usage.  For instance, if you want to run the "bringup_packet_test", you
can use the make script to do so as shown below:

 > make t1

If you choose to run a full regression, a perl script will be invoked by the
Makefile in order to parse the log files and generate a report that contains
test cases with a passing/failing/unknown log signature.

Alternatively, if you don't want to use the make script and just want to use 
the runsim scripts in order to run tests manually, go to the sim/ directory and
run the scripts that corresponds to the test case that you would like to run.
For instance, if you want to run the "zero_ipg_packet_test", you can do:

 > ./runsim.zero_ipg_packet_test
